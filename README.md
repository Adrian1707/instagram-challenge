##Instagram challenge

This project is from the week 7 weekend challenge of the Makers Academy course.
The goal is to try and implement as many features of Instagram to make a clone
of it. I used the paperclip gem to handle image uploads.

##Challenges

Two days really isn't a lot of time for a project of this scale, especially
considering we just learnt Rails that week and I also used Bootstrap for the
first time for this project. Time was really the biggest constrain since I
didn't try to implement any complex models and kept most things as simple as
possible. Due to this, there are some validations missing and some CSS is a bit
off.

##Technologies used

Ruby on Rails

Bootstrap

RSpec, Capybara

##How to install

Clone the repo and run rails server in the terminal and follow the instructions
if asked to set up the databases.

Run rspec in the terminal to run the tests.
